# SplitPay_Promo_Performance_Drop

## Business background

The company operates a decentralized ride-hailing platform, connecting passengers and drivers directly via a multi-channel digital ecosystem - mobile apps (iOS & Android) and web interface. Riders can pay either by card or via SplitPay, a newly launched deferred payment service integrated in mid-September 2025.

SplitPay 2.0 introduced:

- a discount mechanism for eligible users;

- instant installment approvals through SDK integration;

- and a new promotion campaign encouraging SplitPay usage across channels.

The **business goal** was to increase SplitPay share among all completed rides from 25% → 40% by the end of Q4.

Two weeks after launch the analytics and product teams noticed an **anomaly**:

SplitPay transactions dropped sharply: completed rides remained stable, successful payments collapsed by ~3×, while other payment methods (card) stayed normal.

## Questions clarifying the context

The analyst is tasked with finding out:

- 1) Where in the ride funnel the conversion breaks (done → pay)?

- 2) Who is affected (device, platform, payment provider)?

- 3) Why it happens - is this a technical failure, a discount logic bug, or a user behavior shift?
