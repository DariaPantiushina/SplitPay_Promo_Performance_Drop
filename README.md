# SplitPay_Promo_Performance_Drop

## Business context

The company operates a peer-to-peer ride-hailing platform, allowing passengers to book rides via mobile apps (iOS, Android) or web. In mid-September 2025, the company launched SplitPay, its own deferred payment service (SDK v2.0), introducing: 1) a new discount feature (eligible users get a fare reduction when using SplitPay), 2) embedded SDK inside the mobile apps.

The **business goal** was to increase SplitPay share among all completed rides from 25% → 40% by the end of Q4.

Two weeks after launch, the analytics and product teams noticed an **anomaly**:

SplitPay transactions dropped sharply: completed rides remained stable, successful payments collapsed by ~3×, while other payment methods (card) stayed normal.
