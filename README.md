# SplitPay_Promo_Performance_Drop

## Business background

The company operates a decentralized ride-hailing platform, connecting passengers and drivers directly through a multi-channel digital ecosystem - mobile apps (iOS & Android) and a web interface. Riders can pay either by card or via SplitPay, a newly launched deferred payment service.

In October 2025 **a new promotion was launched**: "20% off for rides paid via the new SplitPay in-app direct transfer".

The **business objective** was to increase SplitPayâ€™s share among all completed rides from 25% to 40% by the end of Q4.

However, two weeks after launch, the analytics and product teams detected an **anomaly** - SplitPay transactions dropped sharply:

- the number of completed rides remained stable,

- while successful payments collapsed by ~ 3Ã—

## Questions clarifying the context

The analyst is tasked with finding out:

- Where in the ride funnel the conversion breaks (done â†’ pay)?

- Who is affected (device, platform, payment provider)?

- Why it happens - is this a technical failure, a discount logic bug, or a user behavior shift?

## Hypotheses ("Why SplitPay payments suddenly dropped?")

**1. UX / Product**

ðŸ“Œ Payment button or discount banner is missing after SDK update;

ðŸ“Œ Discount is not displayed correctly - users see full price and abandon payment;

ðŸ“Œ The checkout session is lost when switching between SplitPay and the ride app;

**2. Technical / Integration**

ðŸ“Œ SplitPay SDK on iOS returns an error on applyDiscount() or initPayment();

ðŸ“Œ Timeout or API error in SplitPay service for mobile requests â†’ payment fails silently;

ðŸ“Œ Postâ€“October release introduced a change in eligibility or discount logic breaking iOS calls;

**3. Analytical / Data Tracking**

ðŸ“Œ The event payment_success is missing from iOS logs;

ðŸ“Œ Session ID mismatch after redirect into SplitPay â†’ completed payments not attributed correctly;

**4. Behavioral (control)**

ðŸ“Œ Users intentionally delay SplitPay payments or switch to another payment method (minor contributor).

## Data Mart Schema

The architecture of the data mart includes **four layers**:

1. stg_ (**Staging**)

- **stg_ride_events**(session_id, ride_id, user_id, city_id, device_type, platform, payment_provider, event_type, event_ts);

- **stg_splitpay_logs**(ride_id, session_id, event_type, event_ts);

- **stg_driver_supply**(city_id, snapshot_ts, active_drivers, avg_eta);

2. dim_ (**Dimensions**)

- **dim_device**(device_type, platform);

- **dim_payment_provider**(payment_provider);

- **dim_period**(pre_from, pre_to, post_from, post_to)

Contains reference tables for consistent dimension data.

3. fact_ (**Facts**)

- **labeled**(session_id, ride_id, user_id, device_type, platform, payment_provider, ts_search, ts_req, ts_acc, ts_start, ts_done, ts_pay, grp, period);

- **fact_splitpay_status**(ride_id, session_id, has_discount, has_error, has_fail)

Contains fact tables with normalized funnel steps per session and splitpay_status data.

4. marts_ (**Analytics Marts**)

- **ride_funnel_metrics**(event_date, device_type, platform, payment_provider, period, cnt_search, cnt_req, cnt_done, cnt_pay, cnt_discount, cnt_error, cnt_fail, r_search_to_req, r_req_to_done, r_done_to_pay, p_discount_applied, p_discount_error, p_transfer_fail)

Contains aggregated summary tables for reporting and visualization.

## SQL-analysis

1) Preparation step: normalize funnel steps per session;

2) Difference-in-Differences (SplitPay vs Card);

3) Device / Platform breakdown;

4) Verifying the correct application of discounts (SplitPay logs)

## Creating a Dashboard in Tableau 

["Dashboard"](tableau/dashboard.pdf), also available via public link: https://public.tableau.com/views/SplitPayPaymentConversion-DiagnosticDashboard/SplitPayPaymentConversionDiagnosticDashboard?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link:

1) **Trend Over Time** (conversion "done â†’ pay") - line chart visualizes daily payment conversion rates across platforms. The chart highlights a sharp decline on October 1 (promo launch date) specifically for iOS App, while Android and Desktop remain stable. The constant line marks the launch of the SplitPay promotion, confirming the timing of the anomaly;

2) **Funnel Overview** (conversion per step (after promotion launch)) - stacked bar chart shows funnel performance for each stage: "search â†’ request â†’ done â†’ pay". Conversion drops significantly at the final step for SplitPay users compared to card payments, showing payment completion issues rather than upstream funnel drop-offs;

3) **Discount Health - SplitPay (post period)** - horizontal bars compare Discount Applied and Discount Error rates by device and platform. All non-iOS channels perform consistently, while iOS App shows degraded discount health - only 88.4% applied and 64.6% error rate;

4) **Provider Ã— Platform Ã— Device Diff** - clustered bar chart compares final "done â†’ pay" conversion rates by payment method, platform, and device. SplitPay underperforms across all, but the gap is most critical for iOS App, while Card and Web maintain normal levels.

## Interpretation of findings & Business insights & Recommendations

1) **Diff-in-Diff** shows a clear drop only for SplitPay on the "done â†’ pay" step;

2) In the device and platform breakdown, *desktop* and *android* remain stable, while *iOS* - particularly the *iOS App* - shows a sharp decline in conversion (r_done_to_pay â‰ˆ 0.2). *iOS Web* version has a mild decline (r_done_to_pay â‰ˆ 0.4), so the issue is localized to the iOS App SDK, not the global API;

3) SplitPay logs show much higher discount_error share (â‰ˆ 0.7) for *iOS App* users â†’ the issue originates from the SplitPay SDK rather than from user behavior;

4) **Recommendations**:

- **Fix & Verification**

ðŸ“Œ Escalate to SplitPay SDK / Checkout teams with full context:

- attach sessions and rides with discount_error, discount_applied, transfer_fail for (iOS App + SplitPay + post);

- include Diff-in-Diff comparison vs. Desktop;

ðŸ“Œ Validate the SDK release - check changes in applyDiscount() and API timeouts;

ðŸ“Œ Hotfix: 1) implement client-side fallback for discount calculation if discount_error occurs; 2) enable retry logic for transfer_init API calls;

- **Monitoring / Alerts**

ðŸ“Œ Dashboard: "Ride funnel by device & payment provider" (search â†’ request â†’ done â†’ pay) with SplitPay filter;

ðŸ“Œ Alert when SplitPay r_done_to_pay on iOS App drops > X p.p. below Android/Desktop (2h rolling window);

ðŸ“Œ Synthetic test: every 10 min create a control ride from iOS App via SplitPay; verify discount_applied + payment_success logged;

- **Communication**

ðŸ“Œ E-com director: "Conversion drop isolated to SplitPay SDK on iOS App. Estimated lost GMV: Î” conversion Ã— traffic Ã— avg ticket (target segment, last 7 days)";

ðŸ“Œ SplitPay tech team: "Provide list of affected ride_ids with discount_error and transfer_fail";

ðŸ“Œ Product / Marketing team: "Promo itself is fine - issue is technical, not UX. Once fixed, metrics should rebound within 24â€“48h"

- **Post-Incident improvements**

ðŸ“Œ Add detailed logging for discount_applied / discount_error with error_code and platform fields;

ðŸ“Œ Introduce a pre-release checklist before SDK updates: 1) smoke tests on iOS/Android, web/app; 2) verify "done â†’ pay" funnel; 3) simulate API timeout and error responses
